  object,
  newdata = NULL,
  type = c("link", "response"),

}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{prioritylasso}.}

\item{newdata}{(nnew \code{x} p) matrix or data frame with new values.}

\item{type}{Specifies the type of predictions. \code{link} gives the linear predictors for all types of response and \code{response} gives the fitted values.}

\item{handle.missingtestdata}{Specifies how to deal with missing data in the test data; possibilities are \code{none}, \code{omit.prediction}, \code{set.zero} and \code{impute.block}}

\item{include.allintercepts}{should the intercepts from all blocks included in the prediction? If \code{FALSE}, only the intercept from the first block is included (default in the past).}

\item{use.blocks}{determines which blocks are used for the prediction, the default is all. Otherwise one can specify the number of blocks which are used in a vector}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
Predictions that depend on \code{type}.

\description{
Makes predictions for a \code{prioritylasso} object. It can be chosen between linear predictors or fitted values.
}
\details{
\code{handle.missingtestdata} specifies how to deal with missing data.
The default \code{none} cannot handle missing data, \code{omit.prediction} does not make a prediction for observations with missing values and return \code{NA}. \code{set.zero} ignores
the missing data for the calculation of the prediction (the missing value is set to zero).
\code{impute.block} uses an imputation model to impute the offset of a missing block. This only works if the prioritylasso object was fitted with \code{handle.missingdata = "impute.offset"}.
If \code{impute.offset.cases = "complete.cases"} was used, then every observation can have only one missing block. For observations with more than one missing block, \code{NA} is returned.
If \code{impute.offset.cases = "available.cases"} was used, the missingness pattern in the test data has to be the same as in the train data. For observations with an unknown missingness pattern, \code{NA} is returned.
